# Composite Dual Momentum Strategy Replication

Welcome to the Composite Dual Momentum Strategy Replication repository! This repository focuses on replicating and analyzing the Composite Dual Momentum (CDM) strategy introduced by Gary Antonacci in his paper ["Risk Premia Harvesting Through Dual Momentum"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2042750). The CDM strategy is an innovative approach that combines relative and absolute momentum to dynamically adjust asset allocation in order to enhance risk-adjusted returns and provide improved downside protection.

## Introduction

In this repository, we delve into the Composite Dual Momentum (CDM) strategy, a systematic methodology that harnesses both relative and absolute momentum. By selecting top-performing assets based on their recent performance and evaluating individual asset trends, the CDM strategy adapts its asset allocation dynamically. This allows it to capture market trends during bullish periods and shift to safer assets or cash during bearish phases, resulting in improved risk-adjusted returns.

## Replication Process

The replication process involves using R to implement the Composite Dual Momentum strategy on a portfolio comprising various global asset classes. The strategy's performance is compared against a benchmark portfolio with a classic 60/40 stock-bond allocation. We utilize historical price data to evaluate the CDM strategy's performance over the specified time frame.

## Key Features

- Replication of the Composite Dual Momentum strategy introduced by Gary Antonacci.
- Utilization of relative and absolute momentum to dynamically adjust asset allocation.
- Comparison of the CDM strategy against a benchmark portfolio with a 60/40 stock-bond allocation.
- Analysis of risk-adjusted returns, downside protection, and overall portfolio performance.

## Results and Insights

The replication analysis demonstrates that the Composite Dual Momentum (CDM) strategy showcases promising results in terms of risk-adjusted returns and downside protection. By combining relative and absolute momentum, the strategy offers the potential to improve portfolio performance, especially during turbulent market conditions. Although the CDM strategy's performance against the benchmark remains comparable, its adaptability and momentum-based principles provide a foundation for further research and enhancement.
